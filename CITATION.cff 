abstract: "Advanced theoretical framework unifying quantum information processing across scales through the separated interference tensor formalism. Version 3.03 introduces the primordial equation Ω_c(Φ)=0 with explicit physical constants, a complete topological geometric interpretation, and the Codex-Φ syntactic representation layer. The theory provides precise mathematical foundations for quantum-classical transitions with experimental verification across DNA, neural, and astronomical scales."
