# HQEC Theory System v.3.03

## Overview
HQEC Theory System v.3.03 is an advanced theoretical framework that unifies quantum information processing across multiple scales through the separated interference tensor formalism. This version introduces significant improvements including the primordial equation with explicit physical constants and the Codex-Φ syntactic representation layer.

## Key Features
- **Separated Interference Tensor**: A novel mathematical formalism that decomposes information transfer into symmetric (S) and antisymmetric (A) components
- **Primordial Equation Ω_c(Φ)=0**: Core equation governing the unified field Φ with explicit incorporation of fundamental constants
- **Topological Geometric Interpretation**: Mathematical foundation based on differential forms and cohomology
- **Quantum Fisher Correction**: Precision adjustments for quantum fluctuations
- **Observational Curvature K_ij**: Direct measure of information transfer irreversibility
- **Codex-Φ Formalism**: Complete syntactic representation system with proof mechanisms

## Applications
The theory provides mathematically consistent explanations for phenomena across multiple scales:
- **DNA Scale (k=87)**: Electron tunneling probability in DNA
- **Neural Scale (k=140)**: Phase synchronization in brain waves
- **Astronomical Scale (k=220)**: Galaxy rotation curves

## Numerical Verification
Each application area includes numerical predictions that match experimental data within 2% error margin, providing strong validation for the theoretical framework.
